# Smart-Seed-
Smart Seed was a project proposed in first edition of the Algeria AI challenge (2020). This work was done by an Algerian student team from the Ecole Nationale Polytechnique:

Abdel-Malek Atchi: Electrical Engineering Dpt.

Mohamed Semmad: Mechanical Engineering Dpt.

Mosaab Derba: Control Engineering Dpt.

Sara Messara: Control Engineering Dpt.

Under the supervision of:

Sofian Chetoui: Electrical and Computer Engineering group, Brown University

Description:


The proposal file (Smart_Seed_Project.pdf) is the primary version of the project, it propose the implementation of an edge-based AI application for Smart management of irrigation and weed detection. The project meets positive feedback from the committee board and reaches the final stage of the competition.


unfortunately, due to the disruptive events caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, and after the advise of the board committee to reduce the scope of the project, the project was changed to a plant classification AI App based on leaf scanning.

Dataset:

We have used Flavia dataset, more information can be found on: http://flavia.sourceforge.net/

Code:

Our code was written in Python using TensorFlow as a framework.

data_labeling.py: produce the pickle format of the training and testing data sets.

main.py: contains the core of the classification algorithm with a simple architecture.

VGG16.py: is the implementation of VGG16 architecture on our dataset.

Restnet50.py: is the implementation of Restnet50 architecture on our dataset.
